00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello everyone, and welcome to the 
Minecraft Transit Railway tutorials,  

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,320
new and updated for 4.0.0.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
In this episode, we will cover everything you  

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,960
need to know to get your very 
first railway up and running.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,141
Let's get started!

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,800
One of the main goals of Minecraft Transit Railway 
is to provide fully automated train operation.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
Unlike other railway mods in Minecraft,  

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,560
train spawning and movement is 
programmed from a centralised dashboard.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,720
Simulation occurs whether 
world chunks are loaded or not.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,960
Therefore, there are four main 
components to a railway system.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Rails, stations, routes, and depots.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
Let's see how these pieces come together.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,040
There are a few categories of rails.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,080
Normal two-way rails allow trains 
to move on them in both directions,  

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,800
while one-way rails only allow 
movement in one direction.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,080
These rails have a speed 
limit associated with them.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Platform and siding rails belong 
to the specialised category.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,680
Platforms are where trains can open their 
doors and pick up and drop off passengers.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,720
Sidings are where trains spawn 
and start and finish their routes.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,360
Turn back rails also belong to this 
category and they allow trains to  

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,360
change directions in the middle of a route.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's start with a very basic layout.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
We will build a siding rail, two platform rails,  

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,200
and some normal two-way rails to 
connect everything up like this.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,720
We will then programme the train to spawn 
at the siding, move to the first platform,  

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,760
move to the second platform, 
then return to the siding.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,384
To build this in Minecraft, we will need 
some Rail Nodes and Rail Connectors.

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Place down two Rail Nodes 
and use the Rail Connector  

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,364
to right-click the two nodes to build the rail.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,200
Rail Nodes can be oriented in different directions 
which will determine the shape of the rail.

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Here are some examples of straight 
tracks, S-curves, and 90° curves.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,880
To remove a rail, simply break the 
Rail Nodes or use the Rail Remover  

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,350
by right-clicking on the nodes of the track.

34
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Now we will build the siding rail.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,840
An important thing to note is that 
the length of the rail must be at  

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
least the length of the train we want to spawn.

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,442
For this tutorial, let's build a siding of 40 m.

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,160
Next, we will build the two platform rails.

39
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Generally, the platform should 
be the same length as the siding.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,414
So, let's build them 40 m long.

41
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,800
Finally, let's connect everything 
up with the two-way Rail Connector.

42
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
For this tutorial, we will 
enforce a speed limit of 80 km/h.

43
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,480
Let's go back to our track diagram.

44
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,840
As we mentioned, the train should spawn 
at the siding, move to the first platform,  

45
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,080
move to the second platform, 
then return to the siding.

46
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,640
To programme our trains to follow this 
pattern, we will use the Railway Dashboard.

47
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Right-click the Railway Dashboard item to open it.

48
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,600
On the left, there are three tabs: 
"Stations", "Routes", and "Depots".

49
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,640
The "Stations" tab is currently selected.

50
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,680
On the right, there is a map of the world.

51
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,160
We can use the zoom buttons on the bottom right 
corner or the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

52
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,040
The blue dot marks our current location  

53
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,160
and clicking and dragging on 
the map moves the map around.

54
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,760
Let's get started by defining a station area.

55
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,080
Click on "Add Station".

56
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,960
Click and drag on the map to draw 
a rectangular area for the station.

57
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,640
We will call the first station Desert Plains.

58
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Press "Done" when finished.

59
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:57,040
We will do the same thing for the 
second station called South Sand Bay.

60
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,880
Next, we will create a route 
for the trains to run on.

61
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
Let's head over to the "Routes" 
tab and click on "Add Route".

62
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,160
We will call it "Line 1||Outbound" for now.

63
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
Anything after the two pipe characters 
is considered the route variation.

64
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
The pipe character can be typed 
by pressing Shift+Backslash.

65
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,600
When we zoom into the first station that we 
have created, we will see a small white square.

66
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,200
This represents the platform 
rail that we just built.

67
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Click on this square to add it to our route.

68
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Notice that the station name 
now appears on the left.

69
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,080
Let's do the same for the 
second platform we built.

70
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,720
This one is at the second station.

71
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Clicking on it adds the 
station to the left as well.

72
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,880
Press "Done" when finished.

73
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,920
Finally, we need to make a depot so 
that our trains can appear in the world.

74
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
Go to the "Depots" tab.

75
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Notice how the stations and platforms disappeared, 
but our siding showed up as a small white square.

76
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,680
Let's click on "Add Depot" and draw 
a rectangular area over the siding.

77
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Don't forget to type in a descriptive name 
for the depot and press "Done" when finished.

78
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,120
By default, the siding will have 
no train associated with it.

79
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Click on the siding, which also 
appears as a small white square  

80
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,120
to configure the train cars that will be spawned.

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
Under selected vehicle, click "Edit".

82
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
For this tutorial, we will start with 
a cab car in the forward orientation,  

83
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,760
some trailers, and finally a cab 
car in the backward orientation.

84
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,040
Keep in mind that each car has a set length.

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Because our siding is 40 m, we can 
only fit a few cars on the siding.

86
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,480
We can see the length of each 
car in the train selection menu.

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,120
We will also set the maximum 
trains on the siding to 1 for now.

88
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
To make our depot functional, 
we will need to edit it.

89
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,720
On the left pane, hover over the depot and click 
on the edit button, which looks like a pencil.

90
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,400
First, we will click on "Edit Instructions".

91
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,520
We need to assign our route to the depot 
so that the trains will know where to go.

92
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,880
On the left, there are 24 sliders, 
one for each in-game hour.

93
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,640
Each slider will determine the maximum 
frequency at which trains will leave the depot.

94
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,360
For example, if I set it to 
2.5 trains per Minecraft hour,  

95
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,200
it means that the trains will depart the 
depot no less than 20 real-time seconds apart.

96
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,040
Bear in mind that this defines the maximum 
frequency, meaning that if there are no  

97
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,440
trains left in the depot, nothing will leave 
the depot even after 20 seconds have passed.

98
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,840
Finally, click on "Refresh Path" to generate 
the actual path trains will take on our railway.

99
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,560
It is very important to click this button every  

100
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,840
time we change something such as the 
track layout or train instructions.

101
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,360
Press Esc on the keyboard 
to return to the Dashboard  

102
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,160
and press Esc again to return to the game.

103
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
The train should start departing from the siding.

104
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,520
To see upcoming arrivals and a 
system map of the whole network,  

105
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,080
open the Railway Dashboard again 
and click on "Transport System Map".

106
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,360
When clicking on Desert Plains, 
we can see the upcoming arrivals.

107
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
At South Sand Bay, since 
all trains are terminating,  

108
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,440
we can tick the "Show Terminating" 
box to see the arrivals.

109
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,320
In the "Routes" tab, we can click on our route and  

110
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,120
see the live train positions for Line 
1 with the route variation "Outbound".

111
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
Let's go back to Minecraft.

112
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,640
Unfortunately, there is one problem.

113
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,080
The train doors are not opening, so 
there is no way to board the trains.

114
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Platform blocks, Automatic Platform Gates,  

115
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,920
and Platform Screen Doors can be used 
to tell the train which doors to open.

116
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,000
For this tutorial, we will place 
Platform blocks along our platform rail.

117
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,920
Notice that only the doors next 
to Platform blocks will open.

118
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Congratulations, our first 
railway system is complete!

119
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,229
If this tutorial has helped you so far, 
remember to subscribe to the channel!

120
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,360
Earlier, we configured our 
siding to only spawn one train.

121
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,960
If we have more than one train on our 
system, there is a risk of jamming.

122
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,760
Also, passengers can take the train 
from Desert Plains to South Sand Bay,  

123
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,080
but not the other way around because trains 
at South Sand Bay go straight to the siding.

124
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,560
To fix this, let's modify our setup a little.

125
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,200
First, let's build a second platform 
at Desert Plains for inbound trains  

126
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,872
and connect this platform to the main route.

127
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,255
Next, we will rename the platform to "2".

128
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,321
Let's set up a second route 
called "Line 1||Inbound".

129
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,321
Just like before, we will select 
our platforms for this route.

130
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
We will also copy the route colour 
from the "Outbound" variation so  

131
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,882
that the two route variations, "Inbound" 
and "Outbound", will be grouped together.

132
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:41,280
Now head over to the "Depots" tab, click on the 
siding, and tick the "Unlimited Vehicles" box.

133
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,603
Edit the depot and add the 
"Inbound" route to our instructions.

134
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,788
Let's also reduce the frequencies a bit.

135
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
Remember to click "Refresh Path" again.

136
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,280
With our current setup, more than one train 
can run through the system without jamming,  

137
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,320
and passengers can now travel from 
South Sand Bay back to Desert Plains.

138
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,520
Let's see how this looks in game.

139
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,000
We can just walk right on when the 
doors are open to ride the train.

140
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,000
We can also go back to the Transport System 
Map to look at the arrivals and routes.

141
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,880
Thank you everyone for watching the first episode  

142
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,960
of the Minecraft Transit 
Railway Tutorials for 4.0.0.

143
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,760
Today we learned how to set up our very 
first railway by building rails and  

144
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,800
configuring the stations, routes, and 
depots through the Railway Dashboard.

145
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,840
In the next episode, we will explore other modes  

146
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,320
of transport and important 
blocks for our stations.

147
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,600

150
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
so be sure to take a look at that.

151
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,894
Thank you so much for watching and 
I'll see you in the next video.
